So without further ado, let's head into this week's podcast episode with myself and I, just me here today folks, giving you a full recap on our Aconcagua expedition. Oh, what a journey. It was something, you know, I suppose we had planned our Aconcagua trip quite a while ago. We were juggling dates and stuff like that and we settled on early February. It worked pretty well for me personally, just with work and different things going on. Out West is busy for the summer, Dingle is busy for the summer, so I just felt it was a good time for me to go and so on and so forth. So it was always, it had always been in my mind to be honest with you for quite a long time. It's something I actually wanted to do and take off for years. To be honest with you, I had a good friend who climbed it back in, I believe 2016 and he told me it was one of the hardest things he'd ever done and this guy's done some pretty hard things. So from then on really, I was kind of looking forward to it. We put a fantastic team together and I just do want to start, I suppose, this recap episode by saying thank you to, I suppose, the amazing human beings that I got to share the mountain with. You know, it's always tricky, I guess, when you put a group together, nobody knows each other, everyone's new, you know, we're all doing this really hard thing together and so on and so forth. But to be honest, you know, I think James shared a joke before we left for the mountain the night before we started trekking that, do what you can, be sound and you'll never have to see anybody again. And I think the opposite of that will happen. Some great friendships were formed in the mountain. We had so much laughs that I would often leave myself out of breath. And yeah, like I said, it was just a pleasure and an honor to share the mountain with such an amazing group of people. So in no particular order, Aaron, Dave, Dunneke, Evan, Muirah, Dermot, Ana, Kevin, Sean, Seamus, James, and then Jam. And of course, guys, our fantastic group of guides, our local guides, Gabby, Macca and Hooli. We had a great trip. And like I said, this podcast episode, guys, is just to give a quick, a quick recap of the whole thing. I'm going to give a recap of the day by day breakdown first, and then we're going to go and answer some of the questions from the Instagram question box. I suppose the first thing in any expedition to the other side of the world is the travel. So we traveled Dublin to, Jesus, where do we go? Dublin to Zurich, Zurich to Sao Paulo and then Sao Paulo to Mendoza. So even the travel there was quite full on. But again, it was just good to start. Been thinking about it, you know, chatting about it, training for it for so long. It was just really nice to kind of get that, get that first leg of the journey started. You know, we spent the next day in, in Mendoza and then we headed to Penitentes. So Penitentes, guys, is an interesting one because it's actually, I suppose, right at the trailhead. It's basically, you know, it's on the main kind of Mendoza to Santiago Road. Sort of as trucks passing the road all night, we stayed in a little kind of a hostel. And that was, that was good. I think, you know, at that point, I was certainly, I suppose, I was not anxious, but I was definitely eager to start. It was kind of a good, you know, it was a good introduction. Penitentes is actually not far off 3000 meters. So, you know, when you're walking around, you're like, oh, there's definitely less action available here. You know, so it's a four hour bus from Mendoza to, to Penitentes. And like Penitentes, there's nothing there really other than our little hostel, you know. And then we took a bus to the, yeah, to the start of the trek. And yeah, off we went from Penitentes to Pampa de Lenas, which I think, you know, I didn't track, I didn't bring any devices. I didn't bring any Strava. I didn't use my Garmin. I just went device free. I had everything, obviously, with me and Killy. And do you know what? I just said, look, I'm going to keep it simple. I'm going to walk. I'm going to climb. I'm going to listen to my body. I'm going to relax as much as I can. So it was about five to six hours in day one. And we finished about 2950 meters or so. You know, good, always good to get that first day done. Beautiful trek into the Vacas Valley. It was, you know, like I said, the pace was very gradual, very easy. Everybody went at their own pace. Five, six hour days, you know, you can put your headphones in, you're chilling out, you know, you're camping and so on and so forth. I suppose one of the interesting things about Aconcagua, folks like if you've done something like Kilimanjaro or something like that, obviously you get to camp and all your stuff is ready and your tent is pitched and stuff for you. Aconcagua, you're kind of on your own. So you arrive into camp after the day trekking and you know, you put everything down, you grab a sip of water and then you start pitching your tents. Again, higher up the mountain, it's actually something I found quite hard to do for a day of climbing and then, you know, being at altitude, having to, you know, get rocks and, you know, bending up and down and sometimes after pitching a tent I'd actually have a headache for about a half an hour or so. But again, all part of the job. So, you know, I suppose day one on foot, yeah, got us at just under 3,000 meters. And then we went from Pampladilenas to Casa de Piedra. I don't know if I pronounced that properly now. That was a slightly longer day up through the Vacas Valley. Again, incredibly scenic, like really, really beautiful. Really kind of felt like we were acclimatizing well. So like really long day with about 300 or so meters of elevation gain. So like pretty good for, you know, pretty good for acclimatization. It was actually on this day as well we got our first glimpse of the mountain at the summit and to say that it looked beautiful and scary at the same time was definitely like an understatement. I suppose that that night's camp was good because, you know, it was our last day in the Vacas Valley and we knew that tomorrow we were going to get to Plaza Argentina which is the base camp. So, you know, at this point you have a couple days climbing down, you've a couple nights camping down and then kind of our third day on the trail was a slightly longer day again and we made our way to Plaza Argentina which is the base camp on the Vacas Valley side of the mountain. That day actually started with a river crossing. So shoes off, you know, we had little, some people had crocs. I had little kind of just shoes for surfing and stand up paddle boarding and they did the job. So that icy water first thing in the morning definitely wakes you up for sure. And then we climbed a good bit, yeah, we climbed a good bit on this day. We went I think 900 to 1000 metres up to Plaza Argentina. That was a long day. But it was well worth it because when you get to that base camp you've got a rest day the next day. So that rest day was well welcomed. You know, you're at base camp, you've got a little bit more, you've got normal things, you've got a shower, you know, which is a bucket hanging up kind of a thing and you've got, you know, there's teams there, there's other teams, there's a little coffee shop there, so on and so forth. So you know, life at base camp is good, especially after a couple of days and especially when you know what you've got coming as well. So Plaza Argentina, great place, great memories there. I really, really liked it. So then you have rest day. So the rest day again is tricky because you feel good, you feel rested but there's also, you know, you're looking up over your left shoulder at what's above you and you know, you've hit a milestone but you have a significant amount of hard work to come. So that's, you know, that's all part of the adventure and the journey as well I guess. So rest day again, chilled out, late breakfasts, just, you know, all easy. We kind of got ready to do a carry to Camp 1. So Camp 1, Camp 1 in Aconcagua on this side of the mountain is, you know, right at about 5,000 metres, so 800 metres above base camp. It doesn't look that far but when you get climbing, yeah, it is a tricky one. You've got, you know, I think on the first carried Camp 1 I had about 16 kilos on my back. You know, you get a really nice view of the Polish glacier and a really good view of the mountain. You can kind of see, okay, okay, or like what's our route to Camp 2 and so on and so forth. The trek from base camp to Camp 1 is quite tricky. You've got a heavy pack and then the last kind of 200 metres or so is like just pure scree. It's like soft. It's like, how do I explain it? It's like earthy stone. That's like, you know, there's been no rain there for quite a long time. So it's just so soft and it's kind of like two steps, you know, one step forward, two steps back for parts of it. So that's tough with a heavy pack and tired legs and a tired mind. But again, you know, to get to Camp 1, you know, above base camp, it's always a massive mental win. I found like once I got to Camp 1, we did that first heavy carry to Camp 1. I, you know, I felt great coming back to base camp. So, you know, we kind of rested at Camp 1 for maybe an hour or two. Well, not two, maybe an hour. We had some snacks, got some water in and made our way back down to base camp. You know, so back to base camp that night and the next day was another rest day. So that was a rest day to kind of recover from the first carry to Camp 1. Again, lovely to have, did a bit of what, clothes washing, did a, tried to do a bit of what, body washing and because you knew from really from that rest day on, which was actually day nine in our expedition, for me anyway personally, that was, I knew, all right, this is it. This is the night before the fight. Like you've, this is where the work starts, you know. So it was good, really good acclimatization hike, you know, you're up to 5,000 meters back down. So in my head, I was like, maybe the second carry and the move to Camp 1 will not feel as bad. And I think in my own little notes, it didn't feel as bad. So we left, you know, we left Plaza Argentina base camp, you know, a lot of us got to call home and send messages to loved ones and whatnot, because we were then on our own really after that. So I suppose just, just as a brief, a brief idea, our duffel bags, which is our big expedition duffel bag, gets carried by mules all the way into Plaza Argentina. But after Plaza Argentina, there's no more mules. You are the mule. So you carry everything yourself, everything that you need yourself at least. So you've got your big 85 liter pack and, and, you know, you do some rotations and stuff. But again, I believe I brought too much stuff. Just a little bit, I brought significantly less stuff here than I did to Kilimanjaro, which, you know, as I learn each time. And then once we leave base camp, our duffel bags will stay there. They're handed over to the mules, anything that we don't need until the next base camp. And then they're carried around the mountain by the mules. And they're there for when we get to the other side. So I suppose that morning leaving base camp, you know, we said goodbye to to kind of nicely prepared meals and dinners. We said goodbye to Wi-Fi, we said goodbye to showers, and we said goodbye to running water. And yeah, off we went to work. Like I said, it was like the night before a championship fight or an honor and final, I suppose, or something like that. And yeah, and then the full move to to Camp One was, you know, just under the five hour mark. And then we camped up there. I will say Camp One, I thought was beautiful. You know, we got two really, really nice sunsets and one unbelievable sunrise and cold, significantly colder up there. And the minute that sun goes in down behind the valley, like you can't really hang around. I mean, you can if you want, but you're going to be pretty cold. So yeah, it was, you know, usually when the sun went down, it was there was much else to do other than get into the sleeping bag and wait until the next morning. You know, read your Kindle or read your iPad or whatever iPad in my case, because I left my Kindle in Zurich Airport. So that was Camp One. So again, just to recap, we're at 5000 meters. The next day, we did a carried Camp Two. We came back down to Camp One. In my own opinion, I nearly found the carried Camp One harder than the carried Camp Two. Maybe not everybody would agree with that. But that was just my own kind of personal opinion. Camp Two is 500 meters above, about 5,500 meters above sea level. And again, you know, just a beautiful, beautiful trek and really great views of all the peaks, all the glaciers and stuff like that. And then the view from Camp Two is just incredible as well. So from there, you know, we returned down to Camp One. So this is day 11 of the expedition. And then from there, you know, it's just relax, recover, chill, get some food in, and then prepare to move to Camp Two. I suppose the initial schedule that we had looked at was we were going to take a rest day at Camp One, but we kind of just moved that around. And we actually took our rest day at Camp Two. And so again, just to recap, carried Camp Two to 5,500 meters, returned to Camp One, sleep, eat, recover, and then fully moved to Camp Two. You know, I suppose upon reflection, those two days are kind of not a blur, but like they're two days where I was just like, just trudging along. They were just kind of groundhog days. I just kind of had to get through knuckle draggers, I call them, you know, I came up with that term, crossing America in 2019, like not every day is glamorous and memorable. Every day of course is great. But there's days that I would call knuckle dragger days, where you just have the dragger knuckles and just kind of trudge along through it, you know. So again, you know, reaching Camp Two, another massive, you know, another massive, I suppose, win mentally. You know, you've come so far and you feel like you've been there for so long, but you still have so much further to go. But again, you know, like I said, always good to get to a new camp, rest, recover. I suppose our rest day at Camp Two was, again, there's always a bit of pent up kind of suppose energy, you know, you want to rest or recover, but you kind of want to go as well. And you're kind of asking like, what's the weather like for Summit Day? Like, are we good? Are we not good? Et cetera, et cetera. So yeah, you know, that's kind of what I felt on the rest days. I did find it hard to switch off because, well, A, first of all, there's nothing to do and then B, you know, you just have to kind of sit and wait. So I really enjoyed our rest day at Camp Two because it was like an active rest day. So we did some cramp on work. We did some technical stuff on the snow and the ice right above the camp and just to get us used to, you know, different, I suppose, techniques and descending and climbing on the ice and clipping in with our harnesses and clip moving up and then moving down through the harness and the fixed line. So that was really good. And, you know, you come back a couple of hours later and we had a little pizza, pizza, pizza circles. They were really, really good. Don't even know what was on them, but oh my God, they were, they were stunning. They were so, so good. And that obviously gave us a, gave us a massive, massive boost. I have marked the move from Camp Two to Camp Three as one of the toughest days for me personally. You know, my pack was 21.1 kilos with everything on it. So, you know, you, you, you make your way to 6,000 meters. Again, just for reference, that's one above the summit of Kilimanjaro for Camp Three. So again, 21 kg pack on my back. Didn't use a porter or anything like that on that day because I felt good. I was, felt rested, but getting to Camp Three, I was, yeah, I was definitely feeling, you know, really fatigued and I won't lie. I'm always honest and open on the podcast. In the back of my head, I was like, have I, have I dug too deep here? Am I going to be affected tomorrow for summit day? And, you know, all these things going through my head. And I just had to remember that, look, rest, eat what you can, hydrate, try and lie down and sleep, just rest, rest, rest. And just remember that your pack on summit day is basically empty, you know, so bar just the things you need on that day. Your whole life is in it. So, you know, that, that obviously gave myself, I gave myself a bit of peace of mind there. I will, I will say like, you know, Calera Camp, I'm pretty sure that's what they call it, Camp Three, it's a hard place to be. It's just not a pleasant place. It's 6,000 meters above sea level. You know, you don't much of an appetite, you know, there's no, there's no bathrooms there. Like you're, it's just, it's just a bit wild. It's a bit rough. It's a bit rugged. It's hard to sleep. And, you know, then you have, like I said, I spoke about that kind of pent up energy. I felt a lot of the trip that you've got the summit coming up in a couple of hours. So I suppose getting to Camp Three, you know, yeah, it's a huge win. It's like, okay, we've got this far. We've got one more to go, one more update and that's it. And an update is, is, is when we move up the mountain. So yeah, I didn't sleep great, to be honest with you, at Camp Three, knowing that like, okay, you know, we're going to wake up at half as three in the morning and then we're going to start summoning at five, half five or so. Didn't sleep great. Like, you know, it was kind of a trying to listen to a bit of music, just trying to relax. I've experienced that in the past with marathons, Ironman's events in the US and around Ireland, not sleeping the night before. I'm kind of used of it. So I knew I'd still be fine. I knew I had the fitness. I knew if I got some nutrition in and things like that. The only time I ever felt any nausea on the mountain was actually on summit morning. Don't know what that was from. Possibly just again, a mixture of altitude, nerves perhaps. Couldn't really eat on the morning of summit. So I just sipped them some water and I had two Werther's originals. So that was my nutrition on morning of the summit. Not ideal. I'm sure I've given a couple of nutritionists and dietitians heart attacks there now, but I just felt unwell and I knew if I just could just get started and just get moving and get, you know, sipping on water and breathing and you know that it would pass and it did thankfully, which was good. I did feel like a little bit dehydrated when I woke up. Wasn't really too sure where that was from. Possibly the really heavy day the day before. Anyways, it was a case of like, you know, I need to kind of treat the first three to four hours of the summit day as a bit of a buffet for myself. I just needed to keep sipping, keep sipping, keep sipping. The tricky thing is on summit day is that you've only got about two and a half liters of water with you. So, you know, I didn't want to have it all drank and then nothing on the way down or whatever, because it's a rough day. It's a long, long day. You know, obviously food and things like that are a bit tricky and drinks, but you know, I was sticking to water. I didn't have any coffee since the last base camp, but I had a caffeine gel in my bag and I was said to myself, this is either gonna, this is gonna go one way or the other and I don't need to get into the specifics, but I said if I can keep this caffeine gel down, I'd be buzzing and lo and behold, anyways, I rolled the dice, took the caffeine gel. I felt really good. I felt really, really good. So like I said, hadn't had coffee in like four or five days or like, you know, that kind of a sugary hit. So that had a huge, you know, positive mental impact on me as well, because I was like, right, I'm past whatever I was going through a couple hours ago and now, you know, I'm feeling good and, you know, let's give this a shot. So my day is really hard. It's just so long. You know, the first step is White Rocks. Got to White Rocks kind of after I think like an hour and 20 minutes or so. Felt really good. Then we get to Independence Yehut, which is literally like a garden, like a dog house basically on the side of a hill, little saddle and then we hit the traverse. So again, Independence Yehut is 6'4\", I believe, and then the Canaletta, which some people who have been there will know, is 6'6 or 6'7\". It's like a steep gully that leads all the way up to the summit basically. So we got to the Canaletta significantly quicker than I thought we would. I don't know why in my head, but I thought the Canaletta was like, the Canaletta and the Summers were a lot closer together. That's what I thought in my head. But when we got to the Canaletta, that again was a really good experience. I think we got to the Canaletta, that again was a bit of a mental boost for me because I go, oh wow, like you know, in my head I had this thing like this is going to be next stop to the summit, which it is, but I just, in my head we got there quicker than I had anticipated. So again, the caffeine gel was, I suppose, still working at this point. And then from the Canaletta to the summit, I will say that I did struggle. I did find it quite hard. I suppose, you know, altitude and stuff like that. My mind was kind of gone to be honest with you. Now physically I was very present. I knew I was just, everything got so slow. And it was, a couple of funny things happened. Again, don't mind making a joke of myself here. Started to see one or two things, which definitely were not there. Was still conversational. Was still chatting. You know, was all good. Knew the direction I was going. I was just like stuck in quicksand. Like I was going so slow. You know, this is again completely random and funny. I would see, you know, when people's walking poles would make little holes in the snow and the ice. And I started seeing like kind of Voldemort faces from Harry Potter and stuff like that, which was really weird, but like funny as well at the same time. And again, anybody who's into their GAA, which is another really random thing. I saw like a silhouette of Philly McMahan, the Dublin footballer in the snow one time. And I was like, this is so weird. And I knew myself it was weird. And Gabby, our amazing local leader, asked me if I was okay. And I said, yeah. And then I turned to him and asked him if he watches Harry Potter. So that's what I was doing on the way up to the summit. Trying to regain my mental capacity. It was really weird. It was just funny because I was not present, but I was present. Like I knew I was experiencing these things, but I also knew that like if I just keep chucking away, I'll get to the summit, which I did finally. And it was just such a great feeling. Like it was really good to get to, you know, 7,000 meters. And everybody who left Camp 3 that morning, some of it, which is huge. Like, you know, we were expecting, or like the, I suppose the industry average or the mountain average is in the region at 30%. So that's not very high. But our group, we just blew it out of the water. Everyone was so strong. And yeah, I was just so proud of myself getting there. We're also so proud of the group. It was a special moment. Like the views were unbelievable. It's just a great feeling. You know, you've gone through a lot of adversity. And then it's funny because the minute I summit it, I stopped seeing things and I was like back. I was back in the saddle again. I think you're going through the same thing for so long and you're just like, am I losing my fucking mind here? Anyways, I didn't. I was just like, I'm not going to do this. I'm not going to do this. Anyways, I didn't. And I regained my mind and I found my mind when I summit it and I became a lot more, I suppose, mentally present. But again, the panoramic views were just sensational. And then I suppose in my mind, what I said to myself was, Jesus, that last hour was tough going and now I have to go all the way back down again. So I really took my time going back down where I was going to last in the group down. You know, you're extremely dehydrated. You're in a humongous calorie deficit and you want to be safe. Whatever I suppose experienced going up the last bit, luckily enough, I didn't experience any of that on the way down and I was, you know, I knew where I was basically. And look, you're going up a thousand meters on summit day as well, you know, from 6000 that at Camp 3 and then you're making your way back down. I do remember very, very vividly, all right, you know, like it's as if you kind of feel like you're a little bit drunk. It's the other way if you've had three or four drinks, like you're not like, you're not like, you're not steamed like, but you're fucking, you know, you're feeling good like. But anyways, it was, it was, you know, that's what the focus turned to is, or I need to get out of here, basically, you know, I will also say as well, and like I said, I'm always honest in the podcast. I suppose from the age of 20, I've been doing like really, really long events like this, different events, hard events, you know, running around Ireland and stuff like that. It was the first time I suppose in my own personal life that, you know, I've got a partner at home, I've got a little doggie with a little house, things like that. It was the first time I really started to think about stuff like that, a lot, like I was like, whatever I do, I got to get home safe. If I rewind back to cross America, you know, cycling up Wolf Creek with blood pumping out my nose and up through my lungs, I was just like, drive it on, you know, it's just different, you know, I suppose I matured a bit, priorities change and stuff like that. The sense of adventure and never leave, but definitely, you know, I just wanted to share that as well. That was something I was kind of thinking about, especially coming down from the summit, you know, there's a couple kind of sketchy dangerous parts. That's kind of what was going through my mind. And yeah, we got back to camp three, it was a case of, it was like a zombie apocalypse, to be honest with you, when we were coming back in, it was like something like we're after returning from the front line at a, in a World War II, but food, water, we got noodles. They were really, really good noodles, actually, like two bowls of noodles, because I was, I was starving, I was so thirsty, I was so hungry. And then, you know, you try sleep for a while, which I didn't, a huge storm came in, a windstorm or something, but it was so windy that night. I just didn't sleep a wink. So kind of hadn't really slept for two and a half days or so. And then it was a case of get up, pack your bag, crampons on again, and start making your way down to Plaza de Mulas, which is the base camp on the other mountain. That took us about four hours, I think, with a bit of a later start to the day, just people, you know, chilling out and stuff. So, yeah, you know, you descend down to 4200 meters again, you know, you're replaying the whole previous day in your mind, you're also wrecked tired, like you're really, really, really tired. You know, when you stop and, you know, you take a drink or whatever, like getting going again, you're like, oh, I feel really tired. So that definitely, I definitely felt like that for sure. I know a lot of other people did as well. But to see the other base camp and to see how fast you will go down is like, geez, we took ages coming up the other side. Excuse me. But that was great to get to Plaza de Mulas, a can of beer, a wash, very patchy Wi-Fi to send a message home that we were safe. It was our first time contacting home in quite a while. And a really, really nice celebration dinner with chairs and like stuff, like forks and knives and a table. It was really great. It was really, really good. And then everyone just got really tired and we all fell asleep, which is, which is obviously normal. And then the next day was kind of caught me on the hop, to be honest with you. You make your way all the way back out to Penitentes again. And not like the shit hit the fan, but like it's 28 kilometres of trekking for what you've just gone through. So like that felt like a really long day. But I will say the day passed by really quick because we know everybody's in flying form. The views were absolutely spectacular. And, you know, I think we moved along pretty quickly because everyone was eager just to get the hell out of there at that point, then into a bus and back to Mendoza to the hotel. And we got there at about, I'd say, maybe midnight, one o'clock in the morning, shower and then just passed out asleep. So that's a brief day by day account of kind of what happened, how it went and stuff like that. I'm going to switch now to jumping into some of the questions that we got on Instagram, or we got, I got on the Instagram page, just the Q&A box. So I'm just going to pull those up now for a sec. So first question comes from Owen, Owen 6 and 03. Thanks for your question, Owen. How does it compare against Kili? It doesn't, I don't think. They're very different. It's like Kili is obviously shorter. It's not as high. It's, you know, basically the opposite of that. So it's significantly longer in duration and it's significantly higher. And you'll probably experience a lot more level, a lot higher level of fatigue and tiredness, I'd imagine, compared to Kili. But I will say one thing, I think doing Kili in prep for something like this is a very smart move if you've never done anything like that before. So tricky to compare to Kili. It's definitely harder. But hard to compare like for like. Anna asks, would I ask feeling about my hand to come on the podcast after seeing him in the snow? I'd be too mortified to be honest with you. So probably not. Cheers Anna. But okay, so we have Mark Gerrity 10 asks, cost including gear. So costs including gear. Okay, that's a hard one to completely quantify. I can give you the costs of the trip with flights from Dublin was 6,700 or so. Gear, I mean, that's the that's an open ended kind of number really, because some people have the gear, some people need to buy it, some people rented it. We've, I availed quite a lot of the rental service. And people are like, why did you buy it? Well, you know, some of the stuff that you need to go to 7,000 meters is quite specific. And, you know, we've got a lot of other costs on a monthly basis as well, with business and the house and stuff. So, you know, I knew I wasn't going to be going to 7,000 meters again this calendar year. So you know, I've ailed at the rental service in Mendoza, which is really good. I'm gonna say they were really, really good. Great guys in there as well, really helpful. So I can give the cost including the gear. It's a tricky one to be honest Mark, to give you an exact number of that. We had a couple of questions. Dave also asked how does it compare to Kilimanjaro? So I've already answered that one. Sheila asks, what was the process of training prep like? I suppose different for everyone. I created the training program for the group. Not saying that's why everybody nearly subbed it. But, you know, I think one of the key things here, nobody really talks about this, is you should definitely be injury free. If you have any kind of a niggle or any kind of like a reoccurring injury that maybe you haven't sorted out, trust me, in something like this, it will come back and it'll come back and it'll really slow down your progress. So for training for me personally, I knew I had a high level of aerobic fitness. I wanted to intentionally put on weight. So I put on, I would say probably close to five kilos before I left through food and strength training. And did a lot of strength work and did some weighted trekking with my pack. So I filled up the pack up and down my brand and, you know, things like that, just to get used to carrying that heavy pack. There's lots of other ways to train. You can do some crash training, you can do a bit of work on the bike. You know, I did a lot of running. Just to really build a good aerobic engine and I think strength is key. But again, just to circle back to that first point, I would ensure that you are injury free before you do something like this. So there's a question in here and I can't even pronounce the username, but is Paki in good form and how is the wine after? So Gabby, also nicknamed Paki, is in flying form. Great guy, such an amazing guy. His knowledge, I think we were his 42nd or 43rd time summoning Aconcagua. That's a phenomenal record. So really great guy, so grateful to him, to Maka, to Huli, such like just great people, so passionate about the mountain and it's just really, really nice to see. The wine after was fantastic, really great. We did a wine tour, well we did a lunch in a vineyard. You know, a group of 14, 15 Irish people going to a vineyard and yeah, it was good crack. I'm not going to lie, everybody was in flying form after lunch. So yeah, it was really good. I suppose the winery that we did go to was local, like they made the wine and stuff like that there, so that was really, really nice experience actually and the food was incredible. How long it took, I suppose from Dublin Airport to Dublin Airport, sorry this question comes from Lizzie. Hey Lizzie, how long it took? I was gone for three weeks, so exactly three weeks, 21 days. That was Dublin Airport to Dublin Airport. Did you take Diamox? I did take Diamox, I did yeah. I stopped taking it, not intentionally, but I just forgot from Camp 3 down. I didn't take it at the other, the morning we woke up at Camp 3 after summiting and the morning at base camp I didn't take it because I just kind of forgot and I think my tummy just needed a break from tablets, so I stopped taking it. Then probably not recommended, I think they kind of recommend to keep taking it until you get off the mountain. Anyways, equipment costs, it's tricky to say because I don't actually have a quantifiable number for that because I had a lot of stuff myself and I rented a few bits, so hard to give an actual number on that to be honest with you. Fitness level needed? Kind of covered this question already from G Fallon. Yeah, I would just ensure that you're doing a lot of trekking, you're doing a lot of climbing. I would, you know, you don't have to do another event before it, but I would look at, you know, doing some kind of an camping adventure, expedition style thing first just to get yourself ready for that lifestyle as well. I think that's a good idea. I need an in-depth review of the Argentinian coffee and steak from Henry. So the Argentinian coffee was pretty good, we found a really good coffee shop around the corner from the hotel and I spent a lot of my pesos in there. Good coffee, so great people. Steak, unbelievable. I got defeated by one steak, I couldn't finish it. Beef to chorizo, famous in Argentina, it's just like a lump of meat. In my defense, I also had a massive lump of meat for lunch, so yeah, it's just great. The food there is incredible, really, really good food. Trying to eat the local produce as much as I could, trying to drink the local wine as much as you could, just helps their local economy as well. So yeah, it was really good, food is incredible. Okay, there's like four other questions that are all very, very similar. I'm going to try to cover it now in one answer and I'm going to answer and we'll need to be doing another group next year. Where to next, what's going on next, what's the next climb? Basically guys, we're working on another expedition. We want to take a group on a really cool trip next year in February, so please keep an eye out for that. It's going to be a trip with a bit of a twist. We're going to be working, I suppose, really hard as a group to improve the local communities and the local, I suppose, supports. That's all I can say for right now, but do keep an eye on social media and on the podcast and stuff like that. We will be sharing more details of that probably within the next few weeks, so that's really exciting. We're only going to be able to take, well actually it's quite a large group, we'll take 25 people on this next expedition. It's going to be a six to seven to eight month program where we'll do all your training, we'll have training weekends and so on and so forth. That's my role, but in this I'll be able to help you with all the training. It's exciting. February next year, keep your eyes peeled. I suppose I wasn't asked to say this and I will say from a disclaimer perspective, James who owns Earth Edge is a good friend of mine, really great guy. I've just the utmost respect for him for building an amazing company that actually have, I suppose, they walk the walk. They do what they say they do. They're a fantastic company. They've got great people. They've got amazing values and morals and I am just very happy to be a part, a very, very small part of what they're doing and I'm looking forward to doing more things with them and having a really good impact in 2023 and 2024 with them too. If you have traveled with Earth Edge in the past I think you'll agree with me that they do as best they can for everybody and if by any chance that anybody listening here would like to book a trip with Earth Edge, I can give you a very, very cool code. Capital A, MB, Shane, 100 will get you 100 euros off any expedition with Earth Edge. How exciting is that? Saving 100 euros. That's amazing. That's like half a tank of diesel. No, I'm only joking. Diesel's getting cheaper. I'm going to put the code guys into the show notes. If you don't remember the code, if you can't find the show notes, send me a message on the Instagram and I'll be happy to share that with you. That works across the board guys for any Earth Edge expedition. It's saving you 100 euros but also ensuring that you're going to have an amazing experience. I'm not really pushed about the code but it gives you a bit of value and you're going to have a great time no matter where you go. So Aconcagua, thank you. Argentina, thank you. Thank you.
